# issue-notifier-extension

I was tired of needing of checking my emails to know when someone commented or updated a issue, there are already some initiatives to solve this problem, but I did not find any with open source, so I decided to create an extension to notify me when those changes occurred.

- First, it's necessary install the [github app](https://github.com/apps/issue-notifier).
